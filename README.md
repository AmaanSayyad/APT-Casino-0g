## APT-Casino 

A couple of days back, I was was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of https://stake.com/ which was giving 200% bonus on first deposit, I deposited 120 USDT into stake.com they gave 360 USDT as total balance in their controlled custodial wallet and when I started playing casino games I was shocked to see that I was only able to play with $1 per game and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 coz and when I tried to explore and play other games on the platform the issue was persisting, I reached the customer support and got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits as I was using the bonus scheme of 200%.

When I asked the customer support to withdraw money they showed a rule list of wager limit, which said that if I wanted to withdraw the deposited amount, then I have to play $12,300 worth of gameplay and this was a big shock for me, as I was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back, I played the different games of stake.com like roulette, mines, spin wheel, etc, the entire night and lost all the money.

I was very annoyed of that's how APT-Casino was born, which is a combination of GameFi and DeFi all in one platform where new web3 users can play games, perform gambling, but have a safe, secure, transparent platform that does not scam any of their users. Also, I wanted to address common issues in traditional gambling platforms.

## üß© Problems

The traditional online gambling industry is plagued by several issues, including:

- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** 99% of platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play.  
- **High Fees:** Users face exorbitant fees for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay.  
- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Withdrawal limits and conditions often prevent users from accessing their funds.  
- **Bonus Drawbacks:** Misleading bonus schemes trap users with unrealistic wagering requirements.  
- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralised platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.  
- **User Adoption of Web2 Users:** Bringing users to web3 and complexity of using wallet first time is kinda difficult for web2 users.  
- **No Social Layer:** No live streaming, no community chat, no collaborative experience.

## üí° Solution

**APT-Casino** addresses these problems by offering:

- **Provably Fair Gaming:** Utilising the **Pyth Entropy** on-chain randomness module, my platform ensures all game outcomes are 100% transparent and verifiably fair.

- **Flexible Withdrawal Policies:** Providing users with unrestricted access to their funds.  
- **Transparent Bonus Schemes:** Clear and clean bonus terms without hidden traps.  
- **True Asset Ownership:** Decentralised asset management ensures users have full control over their assets.

- **Live Streaming Integration:** Built with **Livepeer**, enabling real-time game streams, tournaments, and live dealer interaction.  
- **On-Chain Chat:** **Supabase + Socket.IO** + wallet-signed messages ensure verifiable, real-time communication between players.  
- **ROI Share Links:** Every withdrawal (profit or loss) generates a shareable proof-link that renders a dynamic card (similar to Binance Futures PnL cards) when posted on X.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **On-Chain Randomness:** Utilizing **Pyth Entropy** on-chain randomness module to ensure provably fair game outcomes.
